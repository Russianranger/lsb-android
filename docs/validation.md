# Baseline 0.1.0 validation

## Completed locally

- 45 dependency-free JVM checks in `tests/CoreTest.java` passed, including a reproduced/fixed interrupted-rollback recovery case.
- All Android Java sources compiled against the Android SDK platform JAR with Java 8 bytecode targeting minSdk 26.
- D8 generated the actual APK's DEX; aapt2 linked the manifest and resources.
- zipalign completed and apksigner verified APK signature schemes v2 and v3.
- APK metadata was checked for application ID `io.github.russianranger.lsb`, version `0.1.0` / code 1, minSdk 26, targetSdk 35, launchable Activity and foreground dataSync service.
- No proprietary FFXI, PlayOnline, Microsoft runtime, GameHub, Wine or FEX binaries are packaged.

Device APK signing certificate SHA-256:

```text
f1e6b27114c823eaf938d0b43316572303ae9e88743776112a705356c46a035e
```

Keep this certificate for subsequent device builds. The private signing checkpoint is saved separately as `LSB-Android-preview-signing.zip`; it is excluded from git. CI uses a disposable certificate for compilation checks and does not publish that APK as a device update.

## Not yet validated

- Installation and Activity layout on the physical Thor.
- Real Android document-provider imports/exports and background/cancellation behavior.
- A full FFXI installation and a full-size backup/restore on the device; host fixtures are intentionally small synthetic PE files.
- Repair CMD execution, COM initialization, xiloader login and official PlayOnline updater behavior in Wine.
- In-app FFXI rendering/input/audio or standalone server compilation/execution. Those runtimes are not part of this milestone.

Do not describe this build as a working integrated game client or server. File preparation and a TCP-open result are separate from actual runtime readiness.
